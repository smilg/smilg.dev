# smilg.dev

This repository contains a website with an archive of some of my projects, information about me, and contact info. It is hosted using GitHub Pages at [smilg.dev](https://smilg.dev). It uses a custom [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) theme I created (see [themes/smilg.dev/](themes/smilg.dev/)).

A [GitHub Actions workflow](.github/workflows/gh-pages.yml) takes care of building the site, pushing it to [the gh-pages branch](https://github.com/smilg/smilg.dev/tree/gh-pages), and uploading the artifact to GitHub Pages.
