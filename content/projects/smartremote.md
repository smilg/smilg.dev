I converted a standard ceiling fan remote into a smart remote using an ESP-12E development board.

This website is a work in progress and I am pretty busy with school, so I haven't had time to write up complete details for all of the projects yet. Sorry!

In the mean time, you can take a look at [this Instagram post](https://www.instagram.com/p/BtCRbmygEjS/) for more info.
