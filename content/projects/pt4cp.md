This website is a work in progress and I am pretty busy with school, so I haven't had time to write up complete details for all of the projects yet. Sorry!

In the mean time, you can take a look at an archived version of [the documentation website for the project](https://web.archive.org/web/20230405190249/https://pages.olin.edu/jeff-dusek/physical-therapy-cerebral-palsy/) for more info, although it mostly describes the status before I began my work on it.
