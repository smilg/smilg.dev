A customizable fighting game engine written in Python over the course of two weeks. inspired by Smash Bros., M.U.G.E.N., and Street Fighter.

This website is a work in progress and I am pretty busy with school, so I haven't had time to write up complete details for all of the projects yet. Sorry!

In the mean time, you can take a look at [the website for the project](https://olincollege.github.io/super-wild-assault-game/) for more info. You can also find the code in [this Github repository](https://github.com/olincollege/super-wild-assault-game).
