A simple 3.3v astable multivibrator circuit that alternately blinks 2 LEDs, constructed in a style inspired by the works of Mohit Bhoite and Eirik Brandal.

This website is a work in progress and I am pretty busy with school, so I haven't had time to write up complete details for all of the projects yet. Sorry!

In the mean time, you can take a look at [this Instagram post](https://www.instagram.com/p/CMODtj3Dd-G/) for more info.
