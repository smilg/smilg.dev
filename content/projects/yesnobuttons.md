A device I made for a friend of mine who suffered a brain injury. It consists of two buttons mounted on a wheelchair headrest and a screen used to indicate answers to "yes or no" questions. Intended to be used by someone with limited motor and cognitive function. I was invited to speak about it at TEDxVienna in 2016 - [you can watch it on Youtube](https://youtu.be/LNkz7UhH6_w).
