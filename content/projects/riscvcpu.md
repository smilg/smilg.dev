This website is a work in progress and I am pretty busy with school, so I haven't had time to write up complete details for all of the projects yet. Sorry!

In the mean time, you can take a look at [this Github repository](https://github.com/smilg/comparch-f22/tree/main/labs/03_rv32i_part2) for the HDL, tests, and assembly code.
